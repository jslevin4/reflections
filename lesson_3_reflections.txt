When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Use a remote repository to be able to more easily collaborate and share projects with 
others and view and edit your repository online.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes manually allows you to choose when you want to update your local
repository based on the remote.  Maybe other people are contributing to the remote
repository, and you want to wait to bring their changes into your local repo.
